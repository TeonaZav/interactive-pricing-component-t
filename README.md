### The challenge

Our challenge was to build out this interactive pricing component using any tools, and get it looking as close to the design as possible. Also:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on our device's screen size;
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page;
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers
